Hello,

Loading mods from local file is either a security breach or tedious, so I've uploaded this script for my personnal use.

I have merged code sections from the following files :

view-source:https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/main.js?v=2.089
https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/minigameMarket.js
https://klattmose.github.io/CookieClicker/FortuneCookie.js
https://github.com/Ancyker/Crustulum/blob/master/Crustulum.js
https://github.com/CookieMonsterTeam/CookieMonster

As far as I know, I'm not in violation of any license.

I do not consider this code as my property, so if you want to do anything with it, I suggest you to ask the original creator directly.

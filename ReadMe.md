Hello,

Congratulations for finding this page !

Loading mods from local file is either a security breach or tedious, so I've uploaded this script for my personnal use only.

After my first attempt I've found Crustulum's code which was much more elegant than my own, so I modified his work to include the functions I found and adapted in the other links mentioned :

- https://github.com/Ancyker/Crustulum/blob/master/Crustulum.js
- view-source:https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/main.js?v=2.089
- https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/minigameMarket.js
- https://klattmose.github.io/CookieClicker/FortuneCookie.js
- https://github.com/CookieMonsterTeam/CookieMonster

As far as I know, I'm not in violation of any license.

I do not consider this code as my property, so if you want to do anything with it, I suggest you to check the licenses files of the original creators directly.

Just a piece of warning : Some functionalities of this script have the potential of ruining your game if you haven't played it long enough.

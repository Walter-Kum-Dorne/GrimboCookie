Hello,

Congratulations for finding this page !

Loading mods from local file is either a security breach or tedious, so I've uploaded this script for my personnal use and do not plan on making it user friendly.

I have merged code sections from the following files :

view-source:https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/main.js?v=2.089

https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/minigameMarket.js

https://klattmose.github.io/CookieClicker/FortuneCookie.js

As far as I know, I'm not in violation of any license.

I do not consider this code as my property, so if you want to do anything with it, I suggest you to ask the original creator directly.

Just a piece of warning : Some functionalities of this script have the potential of ruining your game if you haven't played it long enough.
